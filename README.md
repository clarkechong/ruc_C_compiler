## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:  
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the compiler.  
- `tests/`: Includes test cases to validate functionality.  
- `docs/`: Documentation and design notes.  
- `bin/`: Compiled binaries.  

```

## Build Instructions
To build the project, follow these steps:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `make`, `gcc`, etc.).  
3. Run `make` in the root directory to compile the project.  

For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<team-name>/compilers-2025.git
cd compilers-2025
make
```

---

## Usage & Examples
After building the project, you can run the compiler using the following command:
```bash
./bin/compiler <input-file>
```
Replace `<input-file>` with the path to your source file.

Here’s an example of how to use the compiler:
```bash
./bin/compiler tests/example1.src
```
This will generate an output file or display the result based on the input.
