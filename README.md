## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:  
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the compiler.
- `src/generated/`: Contains source code generated by Flex and Bison
- `tests/`: Includes test cases to validate functionality.  
- `docs/`: Documentation and design notes.  
- `bin/`: Compiled binaries.

## Build Instructions
To build the project, follow these steps:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies (e.g., `make`, `gcc`, etc.).  
3. Run `make` in the root directory to compile the project.  

For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2024-cw-risky_unprotected_compiling.git
make
# change instructions in future
```

---

## Usage & Examples
After building the project, you can run the compiler using the following command:
```bash
./bin/compiler <input-file>
# change instructions in future
```
Replace `<input-file>` with the path to your source file.

This will generate an output file or display the result based on the input.

## Implemented Features
- **I DONT KNOW**: what to do 
- **HELP ME**: get a grip
- **UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**: why

Here is a list of basic features that you might like to implement first.

- a file containing just a single function with no arguments
- variables of `int` type
- local variables
- arithmetic and logical expressions
- `if`-then-`else` statements
- `while` loops

Here is a list of intermediate features that you might like to implement once the basic features are working.

- files containing multiple functions that call each other
- functions that take up to 8 parameters
- `for` loops
- arrays declared globally (i.e. outside of any function in your file)
- arrays declared locally (i.e. inside a function)
- array initialization
- reading and writing elements of an array (index can be a constant, a variable or an expression)
- recursive function calls
- the `enum` keyword
- `switch` statements
- the `break` and `continue` keywords
- ternary operator (`x ? y : z`)

Here is a list of more advanced features like you might like to implement once the basic and intermediate features are working.

- variables of `double`, `float`, `char`, `unsigned`, structs, and pointer types
- calling externally-defined functions (i.e. the file being compiled declares a function, but its definition is provided in a different file that is linked in later on)
- functions that take more than 8 parameters
- mutually recursive function calls
- locally scoped variable declarations (e.g. a variable that is declared inside the body of a while loop, such as `while(...) { int x = ...; ... }`).
- the `typedef` keyword
- the `sizeof(...)` function (which takes either a type or a variable)
- taking the address of a variable using the `&` operator
- dereferencing a pointer-variable using the `*` operator
- pointer arithmetic
- character literals, including escape sequences like `\n`
- strings (as NULL-terminated character arrays)
- declaration and use of structs

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank and acknowledge absolutely nobody because this coursework is going to be a huge fucking pain in the fucking arse. Fuck.
