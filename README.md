# IAC Compilers Coursework 2025 - `risky_unprotected_compiling`
**Team Members:** Clarke Chong & Kevin Aubeeluck  


## Project Structure
The full passing compiler can be run from the base folder with all features implemented. The first attempt is in the 2025-langproc-cw-repo which was got too messy to work on quickly so we redesigned the compiler structure to make work on it faster.
